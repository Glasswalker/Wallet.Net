This is pretty rough around the edges.

It's only minimally tested.

You need .net 4.1 for it

You'll need a bitcoin server running JSON-RPC Service, and have user/pass configured. Then enter it into the app config.

Do not try the SSH stuff, it's flaky right now, I'm still debugging that.

PLEASE test this on testnet for now. I have no idea how many bugs there may be.

Please let me know your bugs, issues, problems, or whatever. So that I can correct them.

Thanks!
